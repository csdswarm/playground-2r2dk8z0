# Prototypes, Classes and Object Literals in JS!

Javascript is pretty flexible in the types of object like structures you can use. However, it can also get very confusing.

In this session, we are going to go over a few different ways of working with object-like structures, will explain a few of the differences
and help clarify what's different in JS.

```javascript runnable
console.log('Hello World!');
```

# Advanced usage

If you want a more complex example (external libraries, viewers...), use the [Advanced Node.js template](https://tech.io/select-repo/442)
